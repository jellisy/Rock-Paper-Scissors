# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A simple version of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game, written in Python. This project was submitted as part of the Intro to Programming Nanodegree with Udacity (2022).

# Description

The purpose of the project was to demonstrate understanding of classes and OOP by starting with a few lines of prewritten code and developing a functional game with minimal instructions.

- The program plays a game of Rock Paper Scissors, following the conventional rules.
- The program uses classes and objects to store game data, rather than global variables.
- The program displays players, scores, number of rounds, and the winners.
- There are four different computer player classes with different strategies
  - A player that always plays 'rock'
  - A player that chooses its moves randomly.
  - A player that remembers and imitates what the human player did in the previous round.
  - A player that cycles through the three moves

# Instructions

To play this game, you must have python installed on your computer. Copy the file rps.py to your local machine, navigate to the directory in which it is saved, and open a terminal window. To run the program, enter `python rps.py` or `python3 rps.py`
